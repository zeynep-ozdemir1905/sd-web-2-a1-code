## Hints for the Bug Hunt

Look for common errors across all files. There are issues with syntax, logic, and best practices.

- **HTML (`index.html`)**:
  - Are all tags used correctly for their purpose? Review semantic tags like `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
  - Use the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to find syntax errors.
- **CSS (`main.css`)**:
  - Check for simple typos in property names or selectors.
  - Test the site on different screen sizes using your browser's developer tools. Is it responsive?
  - Use your browser's inspector to check for accessibility issues, like poor color contrast.
- **JavaScript (`script.js`)**:
  - **Always check the browser console first!** It will tell you where the errors are.
  - Look for typos in variable names and function calls.
  - Verify that the IDs used in `getElementById()` match the IDs in your `index.html` file exactly.
